# Multi-Agent Retrieval-Augmented Generation (MARAG) System

## Overview
The MARAG system is an advanced framework designed for processing and analyzing complex financial data. By integrating retrieval, reasoning, and generation capabilities, it offers a sophisticated approach to handling financial data challenges. Leveraging specialized language models like FinGPT and adaptive retrieval mechanisms, MARAG ensures robust reasoning, dynamic adaptability, and adherence to responsible AI practices.

## Features
- **Advanced Retrieval Mechanisms:** Efficient data extraction and processing.
- **Robust Reasoning:** Enhanced decision-making capabilities for financial data.
- **Dynamic Adaptability:** Seamless handling of evolving datasets.
- **Responsible AI Practices:** Ethical and accurate data management.

## Technologies Used
- **Language Models:** FinGPT, specialized for financial data.
- **Adaptive Retrieval Mechanisms:** For efficient data management and processing.
- **Multi-Agent Framework:** Enables collaborative data handling and reasoning.

## Installation
